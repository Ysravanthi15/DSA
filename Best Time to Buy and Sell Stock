class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int minPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxProfit = 0;
        
        for (int price : prices) {
            if (price < minPrice) {
                minPrice = price; // update the minimum price
            } else if (price - minPrice > maxProfit) {
                maxProfit = price - minPrice; // update max profit
            }

        return maxProfit;
    }
}

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

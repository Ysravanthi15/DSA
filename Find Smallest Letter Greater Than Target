==============Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target==============
class Solution {
    public char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
        int low = 0, high = letters.length - 1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            // If current letter is <= target, search right half
            if (letters[mid] <= target) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else { 
                // Current letter is greater than target, search left half
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        // If low goes past the last index, wrap around to the first element
        return low < letters.length ? letters[low] : letters[0];
    }
}
Example 1:

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.
